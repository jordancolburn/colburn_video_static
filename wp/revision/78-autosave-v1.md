#"MISSIONS"

In addition to wedding video, we also have a passion to help tell the stories of missionaries and people on mission for the Lord.

We took a mission trip with our home church, Springdale Community Church to help serve and serve alongside Grace City Church. It's incredibly difficult to exactly portray what God is doing in Las Vegas, needless to say, He's doing amazing things through Grace City Church. Here is a short video we put together to show our church during the four short days we were there.
