<p><strong>THE BEGINNING</strong></p>
<p>We get a lot of questions from different people (brides, friends, families) about how we got started doing weddings and what motivated us to begin a career in wedding films. We want to take the time in this blog post to share with you who Colburn Video is and for you to meet the faces behind Colburn Video.</p>
<p>Both Jordan and I (Brooke) grew up in western Kentucky. My love for video began when my Dad bought me a camera for my 18th birthday. Wanting to go in to Sports Broadcasting at the time, we thought that the camera would help &quot;give me practice&quot; being<em> in front</em> of the camera, however, I had no idea that I would fall in love being <em>behind</em> the camera.</p>
<p>Jordan, who has always been interested in film from the beginning (no joke, there&#39;s old video footage of Jordan and his friend making short films when they were about 10 years old.) After taking a couple of film classes when he went to GSP (Governor&#39;s Scholar Program) in 2006, he was hooked for life.</p>
<p>Despite our love for film, it was not something we pursued in college. I pursued a degree in Communications with my focus being broadcasting. I let my love for video go for a while to fully focus on my broadcasting career through multiple internships with WAVE-3 Sports, WLKY-32 Sports, andmany others.</p>
<p>Jordan was focusing on getting his masters in electrical engineering, and we all know there&#39;s not a lot of extra time for film between studying, projects, and co-ops.</p>
<p><strong>THE LOVE RETURNS</strong></p>
<p>I began working at the Office of Admissions for UofL in my later years of college. I had been taking some video editing classes and one day, my boss thought she&#39;d help me out and handed me an old &quot;flip cam&quot; and told me to go film the campus. That&#39;s how it all began. I started making promotional videos for the Office of Admissions and my old love for video came back in full force.</p>
<p>After filming and editing videos for Admissions, a group of friends of mine and Jordan&#39;s got together and entered a film festival being held at UofL. We won and walked away with the grand prize. (We watched the video recently and cringed all the way through it! ;) )</p>
<p><strong>STARTINGCOLBURN VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>Jordan and I got married August 4, 2012. Like a lot of girls, I absolutely fell in love with all things weddings. But filming weddings didn&#39;t appeal to me. Every one I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s in the wedding business, they all say &quot;Oh don&#39;t do it, it&#39;s so stressful, it&#39;s so much work, etc.&quot; And unfortunately for a year, I listened to them.</p>
<p><a href="http://colburnvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/weddingwand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-157" src="http://colburnvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/weddingwand.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="685"></a></p>
<p>Jordan got a job as a Software Developer at a local company here in Louisville and I started reporting for CN2 Sports, a local sport show here in town. I also did some freelance work on the side creating a documentary for the Kentucky Xtreme, did some promotional videos for local shops, schools, etc. This again just fueled my love for video. We started upgrading equipment and began booking more jobs. I eventually left CN2 to focus all of my attention on filming. I ended up getting a job at Southern Seminary in their production department.</p>

<p>I never thought about weddings until one day I was on Pinterest (of course) and I saw the most incredible wedding film I&#39;ve ever seen. The way it captured the day was so new to me, it was cinematic and beautiful. In the 10 minutes that I watched, it completely told the story of the couple getting married, and it felt like I was watching a movie. Not only was I watching this couple&#39;s day unfold, I was watching their story. From then on, I knew that&#39;s what I wanted to do.I knew I was born to be a story teller and it&#39;s the story of weddings that I want to tell. Colburn Video was born.</p>
<p><strong>MISSIONS</strong></p>
<p>At the same time I watched that wedding film, the Lord had been doing a &quot;work&quot; in my heart. I knew that I was called to do some kind of missions but I didn&#39;t know in what way. It wasn&#39;t until Jordan and I went to Las Vegas with our church on a media missions trip that I knew that&#39;s what I was called to do. Ourmedia missions trip basically consisted of professional videographers and photographers who capture the story of these missions and missionaries all for free. Themissionariesare allowed to use the photos for promotional purposes, newsletters, social media, and their website. And the video is all for promotional purposes as well - for their website, to share on social media, to fund raise, etc. We saw this incredible need for what we do professionally in the mission field.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/84273179">https://vimeo.com/84273179</a></p>
<p>We want to continue to do missions but financially, it&#39;s a hard thing to do when you&#39;re working for free. The cost of equipment, music licensing, plus traveling ... it all adds up really quickly. So we began to pray about it.</p>
<p>That was the exact time the Lord opened up an opportunity for us to film weddings.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU DON&#39;T KNOW ABOUT COLBURN VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>A lotof what we make off of weddings goes back intomissions. Filming weddingshelps fund our different mission trips andthe cost of licensing music for the videos we produce for missionaries. Our goal isto travel the world to tell the stories that need to be told of people who give up everything to serve Christ and to serve others. We have had amazing opportunities to serve our church, Springdale Community Church, Grace City Church in Las Vegas, Club 180 in Eastern Kentucky, and The Race Track Chaplaincy of America. And we hope to continue this mission.</p>

<p>The Lord works in great and mysterious ways. He has opened up so many doors with weddings and it turns out, we absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE filming weddings and telling the story of the wedding day. Because it&#39;s not just about the table settings, the ice sculpture or the cake .... it&#39;s about you and your future spouse. Having a wedding film is something you do just for you, for you to watch back years from now to help you not only remember what your cake looked like or how your tables were set, but to see the love that was present during your day. The love between you and your spouse, family and friends.</p>
<p>Let us tell that story for you.</p>
