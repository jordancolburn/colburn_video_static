Don&#39;t be!&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://colburnvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/title3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-216" src="http://colburnvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/title3.jpg" alt="title" width="827" height="245"></a></p>
I completely, 100% understand what it&#39;s like to not be able to act &quot;natural&quot; in front of the camera (why I choose to be behind the camera :p) I always get a kick out of people who are laughing or having a good time who don&#39;t notice me filming them at first, then they lock eyes with me ... and stare ... straight into my camera, then the smile completely fades. One of our jobs as videographers (and photographers) is to capture the day as organically as possible (other than the formal shots) and part of that is to make everyone feel comfortable in front of the camera.
<p style="text-align: center">So, to help all of our future wedding guests, wedding parties, and yes, even the brides and grooms ... we put together a little guide to help you conquer your camera shyness!</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pretend we aren&#39;t there -</strong> I understand that this is very difficult when you see a massive lens out of the corner of your eye. But try to keep your focus on having a good time and celebrating the couple that you love! They hired us to tell the story of their day, and you are a part of that story!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong> Please don&#39;t scan the room and look for us - </strong>True story: I once had a wedding gueststay behind mealmost the entire time during the reception to ensure that she would not be in the video. Don&#39;t always be on the look out for us. This will help you act more natural.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Trust us -</strong> We are professionals! We do our best to use the best footage and audio in order to capture the bride and groom&#39;s special day. We will not use unflattering footage of the couple and their guests. If someone says or does something that doesn&#39;t fit the story of the couple, It will not be used! However.... we do keep threatening to add a &quot;blooper reel&quot; to our wedding packages! ;)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>For our Brides and Grooms:</strong> If you tend to be camera shy, the best thing you can do to insure a great wedding film is to get one of our engagement films like you see here -</p>

<p style="text-align: left">This will help both you and your partner feel comfortable around us and build a level of trust. It also gives you a bit more practice being in front of the camera. Plus, it&#39;s something unique to have that really focuses on you and your story about growing together as a couple. These films can be used as &quot;save the dates&quot; or even shown at your rehearsal dinner, or wedding reception!</p>

<p style="text-align: center">It is uncomfortable at first, but we promise, you will get used to us! So don&#39;t panic if you see us pointing our camera your way. Try your best to act natural and I promise you will be ecstatic with the end product!!</p>
