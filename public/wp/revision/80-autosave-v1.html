<blockquote>Brooke and Jordan: As I sit here, typing through tears, I will never be able to find the words that can say THANK YOU enough for what I have just viewed. Our wedding video is beyond my expectations. The way you captured every element of our event that we painstakingly worked so hard on, the personal interviews sprinkled in perfectly, the artistry, creativity, and finally the way you edited it into a true video heirloom for the rest of our days....it&#39;s over the top exactly what we wanted. Everyone has to use Colburn Video...that is all....lol. Thanks again!

<blockquote>Colburn Video did an amazing job with our wedding video! Our video captured the memory of our special day perfectly and we will treasure it for years to come. They are very professional, fun to work with, and extremely personable! They also did a nice job of knowing when to blend into the background...I never felt like they were in the way. I would highly recommend them.

<blockquote>Colburn video filmed the birth of my first child last October. They were amazing!! For a very personal event, they were so professional and nearly invisible (in a good way). I barely knew they were filming, until I received the most incredible video shortly afterward and had the amazing experience of reliving each beautiful moment! Their filming and editing captured all the highlights and emotions of the day and fit them together so magically. Finding the right videographer is crucial, but I&#39;m confident that with Colburn Video you won&#39;t regret your decision. You&#39;ll probably end up like me, rewatching the video at least once every few weeks and savoring each exquisitely portrayed detail from your once-in-a-lifetime event!</blockquote></div><div class="col-md-2"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
