<p><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>
<p>I sat down last night to organize a bunch of Colburn Video&#39;s files, update our calendar for the 2015 year, checked up on stats from our website, <a href="http://vimeo.com/colburnvideo">vimeo</a>, and our <a href="http://www.theknot.com/Vendors/Colburn+Video/Profile/VID/040/646195/profile?sid=cdKIuSQbwTMccFcJtmoWaghttp://">knot</a> storefront. I started to think back about where we started as a business and became incredibly overwhelmed with how much we have grown. We know that we would not be where we are today without you all. Seriously. </p>
<p>We just want to take a moment and give a huge THANK YOU to all of our stunningly beautiful brides and grooms for believing in us, trusting us to capture your special day, and supporting us even after we filmed your day!! We are truly humbled to see our brides sharing our videos (that are not even from their wedding!) blog posts, and all of the referrals they give to their friends and families! We are SO encouraged by the wonderful reviews we receive and by the unbelievable support. You all are amazing and we love each and every one of you. We truly would not be where we are today without you. </p>
<p>Thank you to all of the wonderful vendors we&#39;ve gotten to work with, for not only being absolutely wonderful to work with but who constantly refer us and share our work. Also, to the incredibly talented photographers who are such joys to work with and have been an incredible blessing to learn from and who challenge us creatively!</p>
<p>To show our appreciation, from now until July 25 book us and mention this blog post you will receive 10% any package*!!</p>
