<p>We&#39;ve been doing weddings for a few years now and I love the opportunities we get to be able to grow and learn not only creatively but on the business side as well. We have restructured our pricing to what we think will best fit our bride and grooms&#39; needs. We have now gone to all-custom packaging starting from a base package and you pick your &#39;add-ons&#39;.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we&#39;re going to explain to youthe new pricing structure.</p>
<p><strong>All wedding films will start at $1,700 and include:</strong>
-All day coverage
-2 Videographers
-7-9 Minute Film
-1-2 Minute Trailer to be put online one week after your wedding
-1 DVD Copy
-1 Jump Drive Copy</p>
<p><strong>Let&#39;s start with all-day coverage:</strong>We don&#39;t want you to have to worry aboutwhich parts of your day are covered, we want to capture your entire day for you to remember. All day coverage basically means we are there when you want us and we film what you want! We will not book anything or have any other commitments on your day, we&#39;ve blocked out the entire day for you.</p>
<p><strong>Why two Videographers:</strong>To provide you the best wedding film possible we always include two videographers. Having two people is necessary forus tocapture all of your wedding details from a variety of angles. It allows us to tell yourstory in a unique way.</p>
<p><strong>7-9Minute Highlight Film</strong>- These videos are our specialty and are included in every wedding we do. You can see many examples of these videos in our<a title="Showroom" href="http://colburnvideo.com/wedding-gallery/" target="_blank">showroom</a>(labelled<strong>Full Film</strong>) . Please note that all times are approximate. If we need 10 or more minutes to tell your story in the best way possible, we will do it! I believe most of our videos average out to be 7 1/2 minutes - 9 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>1-2 Minute Trailer</strong>- Just a little preview of what is soon to come! This will be put online (social media) one week after your wedding and is perfect for family and friends to share!</p>
<p><hr></p>
