<p><strong>Why your Wedding Film is the Greatest Investment you will make in your Wedding Day</strong></p>
<p>When my husband I got married, we did not have a wedding film. (Enter gasps here) I know, I know. But you know what, it is my biggest and only regret from our wedding day. (Side note: this was before we created Colburn Video - now we get the opportunity to provide other couples with amazing wedding films and save them from the regret we have!)</p>
<p>I kick myself every time I edit a bride and groom&#39;s wedding film because I see the importance of it. But like a lot of couples, we didn&#39;t want to pay for a videographer, we didn&#39;t think we needed one or it wasn&#39;t as important as our photos. Although our photographers, <a href="http://stewarthunterphotography.com/">Stewart-Hunter Photography </a>did an AMAZING job of capturing our day, (really, they are awesome.) I wish we had something more. There is something that video adds that photography, just can&#39;t achieve.</p>
<p>I really wish we had a wedding film.</p>
<p>Wedding photos are definitely a must have, don&#39;t get me wrong. But with a wedding film, it captures all of the emotions of the day - the reactions, sounds, the little &quot;I love yous&quot; between the camera flashes, because a wedding is not just a single moment. And with today&#39;s technology and HD cameras, it can turn your typical wedding video into a <em>wedding film</em> at a very affordable cost. It is something that you will watch every single day, something you send to all of your friends and family, and eventually show your children, and grandchildren. It will be your greatest investment in your special day.</p>
<p>We promise.</p>
<p>And just for you, here are a few pictures from our special day! Shot by the talented Susan Stewart and Sam Hunter</p>
