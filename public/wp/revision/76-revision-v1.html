<p>I had an absolute blast working with the team and the coaching staff was so great letting me film every part of the tryouts. Also, for giving me great soundbites to use! The biggest challenge for me editing wise was learning a new editing software. Ive been a Final Cut girl most of my career but my husband (the electrical engineer/software programmer music composer/audio guy) decided it would be a better fit if we got a new computer (that he built ) that gave us more ram, storage, etc. After long discussions we decided to switch to Adobe Premiere and we purchased the CS6 Adobe suite. I love it. Premiere gives you so much more control. Which is great because while shooting the first episode, we mostly shot flat footage with our Canon T3i so we had more control color correcting which was really nice.</p>

<p>I also fell in love with Adobes Prelude which is wonderful when you shoot over four hours of footage, its a great tool to help organize your clips. We did have a bit of trouble with our audio though. The first part of the episode was shot outdoors on an incredibly windy (and cold I might add) day. During post, my husband, the audio guy, fixed as much as he could in Adobe Audition. Overall, very proud of this video.</p>
