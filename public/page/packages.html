<p>Everything listed above is included in our base package! Listed below are some extras or “add-ons” you can add to the base package – We also take requests, so if something is not listed, please feel free to ask and we can give you a quote for the add-on!</p>
<p><hr>
<strong>Full Ceremony – $500</strong> For brides and grooms who also want the entire ceremony on video.  We usually do a three camera set up – one main shot, and two side shots (one of the bride, one of the groom). We also work with your venue to get the best audio possible.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement Video – $300</strong> You can see our engagement stories here – a sweet story telling how you met, fell in love, and got engaged. It’s a great video to treasure for years to come! These are really popular to show at your rehearsal dinner, reception, use as save-the-dates, etc.! </p>
<p><strong>Then to Now Video – $200</strong> Pictures/video of you and your fiance growing up set to a song(s) of your choice to play at rehearsal dinner, reception, etc. — We can convert old Tapes to DVDs for an extra $25 per tape to include in this video – and of course, you get to take home all the DVDs we convert!</p>
<p><strong>Reception Events $300</strong> – although almost every one of your reception events will be included in your wedding film, (typically 10-12 seconds per event) sometimes brides and grooms like to see them in their entirety! This is an event-style of shooting and we capture the introductions, all the speeches, first dance, cake cutting, bouquet and garter toss all in their entirety!</p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal Dinner Coverage $500</strong> Your rehearsal is an important part of your wedding weekend! Remember it with a video!</p>
<p><strong>Extra DVDs</strong> $10 per DVD</p>
<p><strong>Blu-Ray Copy</strong> $15 per Blu-Ray</p>
<p>All discs come with a custom-made menu that make it easy to navigate to your wedding trailer, wedding film, and any other additional videos!</p>
