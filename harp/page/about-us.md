My name is Brooke Colburn and I am the owner of Colburn Video. I specialize inwedding and engagement films, small business, and mission videos.My favorite part about my job is that I get the privilege to be a story teller. Whether it is through wedding and engagement films, or through missions, I love being able to capture these incredible stories through the the lensof my camera and share themwith the world.

We are currently based out of Louisville, KY but are available for world-wide travel.
