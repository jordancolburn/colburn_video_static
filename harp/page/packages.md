**Full Ceremony - $400** For brides and grooms who also want the entire ceremony on video.  We usually do a three camera set up - one main shot, and two side shots (one of the bride, one of the groom). We also work with your venue to get the best audio possible.

**Engagement Video - $300** You can see our engagement stories here - a sweet story telling how you met, fell in love, and got engaged. It's a great video to treasure for years to come! These are really popular to show at your rehearsal dinner, reception, use as save-the-dates, etc.! 

**Then to Now Video - $200** Pictures/video of you and your fiance growing up set to a song(s) of your choice to play at rehearsal dinner, reception, etc. - We can convert old Tapes to DVDs for an extra $25 per tape to include in this video - and of course, you get to take home all the DVDs we convert!

**Reception Events - $300** although almost every one of your reception events will be included in your wedding film, (typically 10-12 seconds per event) sometimes brides and grooms like to see them in their entirety! This is an event-style of shooting and we capture the introductions, all the speeches, first dance, cake cutting, bouquet and garter toss all in their entirety!

**Rehearsal Dinner Coverage - $500** Your rehearsal is an important part of your wedding weekend! Remember it with a video!

**Extra DVDs** $10 per DVD

**Blu-Ray Copy** $15 per Blu-Ray

All discs come with a custom-made menu that make it easy to navigate to your wedding trailer, wedding film, and any other additional videos!
