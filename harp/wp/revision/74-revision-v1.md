<div>Summer is the season for weddings. And we couldnt be more excited to show off the beautiful weddings and gorgeous couples we had the privilege of filming this summer!!</div>

Aside from all the beautiful weddings we shot so far this summer, I think my favorite feature weve added is our {an engagement story} video. I love filming engagement stories! It includes a sit down interview about how you met each other, what you love most about one another, your proposal story, etc. set to music and different b-roll (different footage shot) of the two of you hanging out in a place thats special to you or in a pretty location.

Personally, I like it because I love to talk to people and hear their story, because each story is unique! Professionally, I like it because it really gives us, as videographers, a chance to know our bride and groom a little bit better and get a feel for their style before the big day! It also helps the couple become more comfortable being filmed which will make their wedding film look more natural! Couples can use the video to help promote their wedding online, show it at their rehearsal dinner, and/or reception!
