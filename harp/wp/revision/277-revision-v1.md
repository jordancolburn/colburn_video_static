#"Oh Baby!"

<strong>Oh Baby!</strong>

As most of you know, we offer other videos than just wedding and engagement films! If you've been on our website before, you've noticed our heart for missions and the different ministries we've been a part of and had the privilege to film their stories! You can see one video on our "missions tab" and others on our vimeo page - vimeo.com/colburnvideo. We are also breaking into the corporate world doing a series of promotional and training videos for a company right here in Louisville - FacilityOne.

And now, as of last October, we have fallen in love with another type of video - newborn baby videos! My brother and sister in law gave birth to their sweet daughter, my niece, Charlotte - and we filmed her first moments on this earth (because of course we did - we film everything, haha) and we got to film some of our good friend's newborn girl as well! <strong>So</strong> <strong>this is a new service we are so excited to offer to all of our clients!!!!</strong> Because honestly, who COULDN'T be excited filming sweet newborn babies and their families.

So whether you're adopting, or giving birth and you want a darling video like you see below - contact us on our <a href="http://colburnvideo.com/contact">contact page</a>! Because what a joyous moment that you should have captured!!!
