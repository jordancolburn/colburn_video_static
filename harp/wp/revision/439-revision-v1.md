<strong>Wedding Videography - Frequently Asked Questions:</strong>

<strong>Can I pick my own my music or do you choose the music?</strong>
We license our music mainly through two websites, themusicbed.com and songfreedom.com - these websites let us license music for a very affordable cost. If you would prefer to pick your music, you can look through these websites and tell us which songs you want in your wedding film.

<strong>Do you charge for travel?</strong>
Yes, we do charge a traveling fee based on how many miles away your wedding is from the Louisville metro area. If it is under 100 miles then there is no travel fee. If you are having a destination wedding, please contact us.

<strong>Can I add any add-ons after I have signed a contract?</strong>
Of course! You can choose any add-ons up to two months before your wedding day! However, you may not take away from any add-ons once the contract has been signed.

<strong>How do I officially book Colburn Video?</strong>
Once you have decided to go with us :) we will send you a contract via email. Once you receive the contract you can either print it out, sign it and mail it back to us with the deposit included or you may scan it and send it back via email and send the deposit separately.

<strong>Do you take credit card?</strong>
At the moment, no we do not accept credit cards. Checks made out to Colburn Video are best.

<strong>How much is the deposit?</strong>
We require a $400 non-refundable deposit to officially reserve your day. This will come out of the total price. The remaining balance is due on or before your wedding day.

<strong>Can you stylize our wedding film?</strong>
We can do lots of different styles. Show us an example of a style you would like i.e. vintage look, black and white - and we can make that happen!

<strong>Will you need to come to the rehearsal?</strong>
If you chose the full ceremony as an add on, and you are getting married at a venue we are not familiar with, we will most likely ask to be at the rehearsal so we can pick the best camera angles, and work with your venue to get the best audio possible.

<strong>Will my add-ons be included on the same DVD or all on separate DVD?</strong>
All of the videos you choose from our add-ons will be included on one DVD. We custom-make our menus that helps you easily navigate through all of the videos from your special day!
