#"a new heart for media missions"

<strong>Colburn Video</strong>specializes in small business promotions and wedding and engagement films, but more recently God has laid it on our hearts to be more involved in Media Missions. This blog post will be quite different than the other ones posted, a bit more personal. But a more professional blog post (about equipment, editing tools, audio, etc.) to follow

We got to take our first media mission trip to Las Vegas and serve along side Grace City Church, a group of 20-something-year-olds who last year, picked up their lives, and moved out to Las Vegas along with Dave Earley, Lead Pastor at Grace City, and basically do what all the churches are called to do serve.

There are over 10,000 homeless people living in Las Vegas, last year the government rescued 131 minors from prostitution. Las Vegas is no doubt, a lost city, after all, it is in fact, called Sin City.

The area of Paradise where Grace City does most of its mission, is considered to be 2% evangelical christian. The International Mission Board (IMB) considers anything under 3%, an unreached people group. The percentage for evangelical christians in Las Vegas is 4-5%, so out of 100 people, 95-96 of those people are not saved. There are more evangelical christians in South America, parts of Asia, and Europe where we send missionaries to go and spread the gospel.

What Grace City Church wants to do  transform Sin City into Grace City . seems like mission impossible. But as I have learned, to never underestimate God, His capabilities, and how he can use the lost, inexperienced, and use the people who have a heart to serve, to change the world. And I believe thats how hes using Grace City.

<em>"I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail"</em><strong>Matthew 16:18</strong>

What I got to experience in the four days I was in Las Vegas was beyond incredible. The heart for service of the people of Grace City was intoxicating. They throw block parties in parks across Vegas - some parks more dangerous than others, one in particular has a lot of gang and drug issues - which happens to be the home of many homeless people . Its a party where they feed everyone for free, play games with the children, and share the gospel.

This is a church that meets in a middle school. They set up and tear down every Sunday. They are less concerned with the kind of music they play, whether or not its two services, or the temperature in the sanctuary. This is a church whose focus is on prayer, service, and spreading the Gospel.

<strong>Here, we are interviewing Andrew Earley, Dave Earleys son who helped lead the missionaries to start Grace City Church.</strong>

We went with a team of six people from our home church, Springdale Community Church, equipped with professional photographers and videographers. We wanted to help serve in anyway they needed, and also through media. We all know how expensive photographers and videographers can be, and we all did it at no cost to them, they will have all of the rights to the photographs and video to do with what they need.

I think its an incredible service and a service I would love to continue doing  to be able to tell amazing stories, through photographs and video, of how God is working. We went down and shot almost 10 hours of footage. We are going to put together four videos for them to promote what theyre doing down in Vegas. We will have the first video up shortly and the next three in the weeks to come.

H<strong>ere is a picture of Mike, praying over us  my heart melted. He was homeless and was saved 13 days ago and became a part of Grace City Church. Not only did he pray for us, he prayed for almost everyone who met for morning prayer walking and worship. God is so good.</strong>
